Our team is working on building a code execution engine directly in the browser which can be used by developers to rapidly test and implement various prototypes without going through the hassle of setting up a new development environment on their local machines. Using Web Assembly developers will be able to see instant results of their code without ever having to build or run. Since the engine is built in the browser itself, HTML and CSS layout prototyping can be leveraged  via iFrames, thus speeding up the development process.","isFork":false,"languages":[{"name":"HTML","iconifyClass":"logos-html-5"},{"name":"CSS","iconifyClass":"logos-css-3"}]},{"id":"R_kgDOHC6LCg","name":"Golang-Projects","createdAt":"2022-03-22T14:47:19Z","url":"https://github.com/ritikchawla/Golang-Projects","description":"Collection of all golang projects done","isFork":false,"languages":[{"name":"HTML","iconifyClass":"logos-html-5"}]},{"id":"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkzMDgyNDkwMTI=","name":"Course-Projects-Data-Analysis-and-Deep-Learning-","createdAt":"2020-10-29T07:23:49Z","url":"https://github.com/ritikchawla/Course-Projects-Data-Analysis-and-Deep-Learning-","description":"My course projects from the courses offered by Jovian ML.
